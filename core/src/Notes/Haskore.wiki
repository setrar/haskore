[[Haskore | http://www.haskell.org/haskore/]] is a set of Haskell modules for creating music as MIDI, CSound, and Audio files.

A lot of projects were initiated that use the Haskore framework or something in the spirit of Haskore. This Wiki may help to keep an overview of all projects. All maintainers of Haskore related projects are encouraged to add there project here.

|| AutoTrack || Stefan Ratschan || [http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/~ratschan/autotrack/] || A tool for creating practizing and demo tracks from chord charts.  You feed the program with a chord chart, set the desired style (jazz, bossa, etc.), tempo, key etc. and it produces a simple MIDI file containing an according bass and drum track. Includes a lot of examples. ||
