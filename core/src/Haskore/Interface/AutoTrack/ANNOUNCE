I would like to announce version 0.2a of 

                   AutoTrack 

a tool for creating practizing and demo tracks from chord charts.  You feed the
program with a chord chart, set the desired style (jazz, bossa, etc.), tempo,
key etc. and it produces a simple MIDI file containing an according bass and
drum track. Future versions will be able to assist in creating arbitrary
complicated demo tracks.

AutoTrack has been created using the functional programming language Haskell
(http://www.haskell.org). It builds upon Paul Hudak's library Haskore
(http://www.haskell.org/haskore).

Further information can be obtained from the AutoTrack website
(http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/sratscha/autotrack).
