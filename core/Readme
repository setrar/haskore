 			 Haskore Music System
			 --------------------

This is a revised and extended version of Haskore from

  http://darcs.haskell.org/haskore/

which evolved from the February 2000 release, available from:

  http://haskell.org/haskore/

The features are:
 - music can be composed by programming Haskell
 - the music is output into MIDI files, CSound, or SuperCollider,
   or even rendered to an audio stream with http://darcs.haskell.org/synthesizer/
 - CSound instruments can generated by programming Haskell, as well

 - all modules can be used with GHC,
   and many of them with Hugs

For more details, refer to the Tutorial.


For installation we recommend Cabal.

$ ./Setup.lhs configure --user
$ ./Setup.lhs build
$ ./Setup.lhs haddock
$ ./Setup.lhs install

This way you have a usable Haskore installation.

However most modules are written in literate style with LaTeX markup.
There are no Haddock comments.
You can build a PDF file which introduces you to the internals of Haskore.
However it got a bit out of sync over the time,
many parts are now extracted into separate packages.
You can build the documentation using

$ make pdf

.

Certainly you will want to try some examples.
To this end you must have installed CSound or a MIDI player, respectively.

$ make ghci   # interactive session in GHC
or
$ make hugs   # interactive session in Hugs
...
*Main> :load Haskore.Interface.CSound.Tutorial
...
*Haskore.Interface.CSound.Tutorial> test tut13
...
*Main> :load Haskore.Interface.MIDI.Render Haskore.Example.ChildSong6
...
*Haskore.Interface.MIDI.Render> playTimidity Haskore.Example.ChildSong6.song
...

You can choose other MIDI players. Type

*Haskore.Interface.MIDI.Render> :browse Haskore.Interface.MIDI.Render

to see the alternatives.

If you like to play via SuperCollider,
install the haskore-supercollider package
from http://darcs.haskell.org/haskore-supercollider
and continue with its Readme file.
